# TODO

Tracked follow-up work. Each item: what, why it was deferred, and enough of a starting
point that picking it up doesn't need a fresh investigation.

## Diagnostic ("ABL") wind model: close the last ~5-10% gap to the CFD

**Status:** shipped behind `World.wind_model` (Controls window; `"cfd"` default,
`"diagnostic"` opt-in). See `docs/simulation-model.md#wind-model`.

**Where it stands.** `"diagnostic"` skips the shallow-water solve entirely and rebuilds
wind from `climate.compute_wind` plus air temperature from
`climate.compute_air_temperature_diagnostic` (radiative-equilibrium temperature +
`AIR_TEMP_DIFFUSION_ITERATIONS` gentle Jacobi passes). Measured against a 12-15 step CFD
run at `fluid_density=2.0` across three seeds:

| | vs CFD |
|---|---|
| land-biome agreement | ~84-91% |
| precipitation rel-RMS | ~8-11% |
| air-temperature rel-RMS | ~9-11% |
| step wall-clock | ~6x faster at `fluid_density=2.0` (12 steps: 42s -> 7s); ~1.5x at 0.5, more at 4.0. CFD substep loop itself ~15x. |

The wind *field* barely matters downstream (swapping CFD wind for `compute_wind` while
keeping CFD air temperature holds land-biome agreement at ~95%). Almost the entire residual
gap is **air temperature**: `compute_air_temperature_diagnostic` reproduces the CFD's
near-radiative-equilibrium field to ~9% but not its genuine advective/diffusive structure,
nor the fact that the CFD temperature is still crawling toward equilibrium from its
maritime-moderated bootstrap for the first dozen-plus steps.

**What was tried and rejected.** Adding a single semi-Lagrangian downwind advection of the
equilibrium field along the diagnostic wind (blend 0.4-0.5, 12-18 deg) made agreement
*worse* (~68-73%) at every setting swept -- either the `1/lambda_radiative` characteristic
length is being mis-estimated or the one-shot advection over-corrects. Adding any maritime
moderation (`compute_air_temperature`'s nearest-ocean pull) also made it worse -- the CFD
does not do that.

**Options for closing it, roughly in effort order:**

1. **Quasi-steady linear correction.** Solve the steady advection-diffusion-relaxation
   balance `u.grad(T) = kappa*lap(T) + lambda*(T_eq - T)` approximately -- a handful of
   Jacobi/Gauss-Seidel sweeps of that elliptic operator on the climate grid, seeded from
   `T_eq`. Pure numpy, ~5-15 ms. This is the principled version of the failed one-shot
   advection: iterating the operator instead of applying it once should avoid the
   over-correction. Constants (`kappa`, `lambda`) can start from
   `atmosphere_cfd.TEMPERATURE_DIFFUSIVITY_M2_S` / `RADIATIVE_RELAXATION_PER_S`.

2. **Lightweight prognostic temperature.** Keep a persistent `(H, W)` air-temperature field
   on `World` (or on a slimmed diagnostic state), advected each step by `compute_wind`'s
   output + diffused + relaxed toward `T_eq` -- an explicit temperature-only integrator with
   no gravity-wave CFL, so ~10-30 substeps not ~1000. Recovers the "still relaxing from the
   bootstrap" transient the closed-form version can't. Costs a new persisted field and a
   save/load bump.

3. **Accept it.** 85-91% land biomes at 1/10th-1/25th the cost is already the intended
   trade. Document the gap in the Controls tooltip (done) and move on.

**Validation harness.** `test_diagnostic_wind_model_tracks_the_cfd_biome_map`
(`backend/stress_tests/test_climate.py`) already steps one world ~10 times each way and
asserts land-biome agreement > 0.78 and precipitation rel-RMS < 0.25 -- a regression floor,
not a tight bound. If this item is picked up, tighten those numbers as the approximation
improves, and add per-seed / per-density coverage (the agreement is config-sensitive:
~72% at `climate_density=4.0 / fluid_density=1.0`, ~84-89% at 2.0/2.0).

**Tuning note.** `AIR_TEMP_DIFFUSION_ITERATIONS` / `AIR_TEMP_DIFFUSION_WEIGHT` (climate.py)
were picked from a 3-seed sweep at 15 steps; 6 passes at weight 0.5 was the best of
{raw, 3, 6, 8, 12}. Worth re-sweeping if the land-temperature mapping
(`LAND_TEMP_MIN_C`/`RANGE`) or the biome thresholds change.

**Also:** `_advance_fluid_dynamics`'s `compute_climate(skip_moisture=True)` forcing snapshot
is still built every step in `"cfd"` mode (~20-60 ms) -- unrelated to this flag, but the
cheapest remaining CFD-path saving if that mode's per-step cost is ever revisited.

## Deferred work found in code/doc comments

A sweep of every source file (2026-08-27) turned up **no `TODO`/`FIXME` comments** -- this
codebase tracks follow-ups here, not inline. The items below are the loose ends the comments
*do* describe, collected so picking one up doesn't need a fresh grep.

### `PlateWithRTree` line regularization

**Where:** `plates.py` (`PlateWithRTree`), noted in `docs/architecture.md` (plates.py entry:
"inline line regularization (`PlateWithRTree`'s own versions are still a TODO)").

`PlateWithLines.deform()` does inline line growth/shrinkage and regularization per turn.
`PlateWithRTree` -- the R-tree-backed variant -- doesn't carry equivalent regularization
logic. If `PlateWithRTree` is meant to become a drop-in replacement, it needs its own
version of the per-turn node density / spacing upkeep (`elevation_lines.py`,
`TARGET_LINE_SPACING_RAD`), otherwise its lines drift out of spec over a long run.

### `bvh.py` tree-vs-tree traversal is built but not wired into the sim

**Where:** `torque.py` ~line 100 ("Not yet exercised at runtime; kept available and
independently tested").

`bvh.py`'s `query_nearest_cross` (tree-vs-tree) is validated against brute force
(`unit_tests/v2/test_bvh.py`) but nothing in the running simulation calls it. The per-step
per-plate nearest-neighbour query in `torque.py` deliberately uses `scipy` `cKDTree` instead
(compiled batch query beats the pure-Python BVH recursion badly at ~16k nodes/plate -- ~2
min vs a couple of seconds for an 8-step run). The intended call site for the BVH version is
a smaller, less frequent query -- `merge_split.py`'s collision-pair proximity check is
called out as "the natural next call site." Either wire it in there, or drop `bvh.py`'s
cross-traversal path if it's never going to be used.

### `World.volcanic_field_plate_ids` is dead state

**Where:** `world.py` ~line 70 ("Nothing populates this set any more ... kept for now").

Since `PlateWithLines.deform()` started spawning overstretched-rift volcanoes as new nodes
on the plate's own line (rather than as a separately tracked volcanic-field plate), nothing
adds to `volcanic_field_plate_ids`. Per-node eruption rolling in `volcanism.py` reads
`is_volcano` directly and doesn't need it. It's retained only as a place to report a field
"cooling" if per-field tracking ever comes back. Decide: revive the tracking, or remove the
field (and bump save/load).
